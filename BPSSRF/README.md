## Description

I've built the ultimate SSRF protection you can use it for any web application! It checks hostnames, validates IPs, prevents DNS rebinding, and even limits redirects. There's absolutely no way anyone could bypass this security layer. I've been testing it extensively, and I'm confident it's bulletproof. Want to prove me wrong? Good luck with that - you'll need it!
